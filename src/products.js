    About the Author
    Hi. I have been a web designer / developer for the past 10 years. I am still learning and enjoy helping others learn as well. I have worked in various corporate settings and as a freelancer. I enjoy working with Bootstrap and WordPress to build responsive websites. I earned a bachelors graphic design degree around the time CSS and web standards were just starting to take hold. My primary focus was print design but gradually began doing more web projects. Then in 2009 I got my first job as a web designer writing a ton of CSS and realizing I had a long journey of learning ahead. I now share some of the things I learned along the way to help you learn faster and in a more friendly way.
